    <h1>Sun</h1>
    <p>
        The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of gas, primarily made of hydrogen and helium.<br>
        It is the center of our solar system and provides the light and heat necessary for life on Earth.<br>
        The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing<br>
        enormous amounts of energy in the process. It has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers and is<br>
        about 93 million miles away from Earth.
